## Activities: - Waiting for concrete date for Bully immigration to production on RedCast side.

- PMO situation mostly resolved; new board created in retail domain space. Booking to account RUNICON25. Need to clarify if this is correct for ongoing maintenance tasks.
- Data topics: No further progress expected from us for now. Adding event tracking is out of scope.
- UI consistency: Remaining with both iterations of autopicker until further migration plans are shared.
- Playwright tests: Partly fixed, ongoing fixes.
- App monitoring: Fixed some Sentry errors, less noisy now. Discussed GCP errors with Sebastian, need to decide on approach.

## Next steps: - Get written confirmation about PMO booking.

- Finalize fixing Playwright tests.
- Migrate Bully to production.
- Finish improvements about app monitoring, Sentry, and GCP errors.

## Support needed: No support needed at the moment.
