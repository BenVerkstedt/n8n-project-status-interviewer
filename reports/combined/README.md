# Combined weekly project status reports

This folder is filled by the n8n workflow **Project Status Consolidation**.

- **One Markdown file per week**, named by calendar week and year: `YYYY-KWww-project-status.md`
- Example: `2026-KW08-project-status.md` for calendar week 8 of 2026

The workflow runs weekly (e.g. Thursday 08:00), merges all project status Google Docs for the current week into a single document, and commits it here.
