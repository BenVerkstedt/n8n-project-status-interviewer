\#\# Activities: Waiting for a concrete date for the body migration. Resolved the PMO situation with a new booking account: runitcon25. No further progress on data topics; a separate project will be needed. UI consistencies remain. Partially fixed several broken Playwright tests, with some still ongoing. Resolved some Sentry errors. Discussing GCP errors with Sebastian from infrastructure.

\#\# Next steps: Get written confirmation for the new booking account (runitcon25). Finalize fixing remaining Playwright tests and GCP errors. Await final date for the BUDY migration.

\#\# Support needed: No support is needed at the moment.
